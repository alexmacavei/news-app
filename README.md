**React Native with Typescript**

This app is created using React Native CLI and Typescript, making also use of hooks instead of any 3rd party state management tool. It uses the cool News API at https://newsapi.org/.

Developed and tested on MacOS, ran with 

```react-native run-ios --simulator "iPhone X"```

It's simple enough that it's almost boilerplate :)
